This project is mostly a way to learn async programming.

Network io and user io will be the 2 factors that will be optimized by async.
Saving information to the database willl involve file io but because this is 
much faster than the other 2 I don't think that async will help much.

Initially I would like to have a basic ping scan that happens periodically.
The results are displayed as a chart of sorts on a terminal using curses.
I will want to have some way to look at the history of each host.
